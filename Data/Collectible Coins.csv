Hi there, I'm Océane, the boss lady, owner of this mini craft empire.

FrereFeter Gifts started with a sentence- a sentence from my friend who encouraged me when I was down:
""""If there is a shadow in front of you, it is because there is sunshine behind you """".
And now it continues my initial touch with a lot of sentences, a lot of simple but meaningful sentences that might bring joy to people.

I myself have benefited from actions brought about by verbal expressions- my friend encourage me through a small card - so I want to do the same thing,
I want to turn words into action, want to use seemingly ordinary words to bring comfort and hope to people, want to bring an extra touch of color to our life.
If you have ever felt even the slightest bit of happiness because of FrereFeter's products, that is what FrereFeter means.
“It is much harder to turn words into actions than to turn actions into words,” but that's what we trying to do.

Finally, I'd like to give you the sentence we started with: If there is a shadow in front of you, it is because there is sunshine behind you.

May you be happy, may you be confident, may you be brave, may you be proud of yourself：)


Oh, one last thing~
