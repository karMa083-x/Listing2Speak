0,2000 Mules DVD by D'Souza Media New Version with Menu Selections and Subtitles - Deluxe Edition,$24.95,n/a,4.4 out of 5,2.0,0.0,"Dinesh D'Souza's documentary film 2000 Mules tells the never before told story of what really happened in the 2020 election. Forget everything you know or think you know about election fraud. 2000 Mules exposes a massive network of coordinated fraud across all five of the states that decided the election. This fraud was more than sufficient to change the outcome. The film uses two types of evidence. The first is geotracking which monitors the cell phone movements of mules or paid criminal traffickers delivering illegal ballots to mail in drop boxes. It's a new technology used for the first time to bust a very old type of fraud. The second is video evidence, obtained from the official surveillance cameras installed by the states themselves. The film takes you to the scene of the crime, again and again and again. You can actually watch the criminals at work. Finally, the film decisively answers the most important question is who really won the 2020 election? This is a movie that documents the biggest heist in American history. Its goals are to reveal how it happened, who did it, and how to make sure that this never happens again. This movie features Catherine Engelbrecht, Eric Metaxas, Charlie Kirk, Dennis Prager, Gregg Phillips, Larry Elder, Sebastian Gorka",212.0,1.0

80,Raging Bull The Criterion Collection,$24.99,n/a,4.6 out of 5,3.0,0.0,"With this stunningly visceral portrait of self-destructive machismo, Martin Scorsese created one of the truly great and visionary works of modern cinema.

Thelma Schoonmaker’s Oscar-winning editing, Michael Chapman’s extraordinarily tactile black-and-white cinematography, and Frank Warner’s ingenious sound design combine to make Raging Bull a uniquely powerful exploration of violence on multiple levels—physical, emotional, psychic, and spiritual.
