The Medela Breast Milk Storage Bags have been hygienically pre-sealed with durable material and double-zipper protection to prevent leaking. These bags safely store breastmilk in the freezer, fridge, or when traveling. These ready to use breastmilk storage bags are constructed from a durable, double-layer material with a built-in double zipper seal to keep your breastmilk safely stored in the fridge or freezer.
The Medela breastmilk storage bags have been designed to be self-standing and come with a large write-on area. This allows you to document the date and other vital information for safer storage and use. Also, the Medela Breast Milk large 6-ounce Storage Bags have been designed to lay flat for space-saving storage. This unique feature allows quick thawing of frozen milk when your baby is hungry. To help you keep these breastmilk storage bags clean and organized, we’ve added a bonus resealable transport pouch that keeps unused bags organized and clean.
Medela offers two types of storage bags to fit your lifestyle. Our new breast milk storage bags are for moms looking for save only bags and who don't need or want to pump directly into the bag, while our Pump & Save bags are designed for moms who want the added convenience of pumping directly into the bag. With either choice, we've got you covered. Medela’s primary focus is on helping moms to successfully breastfeed their babies for as long as they choose. Meeting this goal responsibly is at the heart of everything we do.",288.0,3.0
